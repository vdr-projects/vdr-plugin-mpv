Description
-----------

vdr-mpv is a fork of the vdr-play plugin from Johns. It uses libmpv for playing
media (video, audio, picture) in VDR and also displays the VDR OSD (On Screen Display) during playback.
You can play internet or network streams also. For this you need make mpv with lua script
and youtube-dl (for youtube stream).
You can record some network stream, and play it like normal vdr recordings. This is an experimental mpv
function, so some streams may not be recorded correctly. Recording is made to the vdr video directory.

Requirements
------------

- VDR version >= 2.2.0 (earlier versions may work, but are untested)
- libmpv >= 0.30.0 (for old version use vdr-plugin-mpv 0.0.4.
- xrandr (only needed for modeline switching)
- libcdio (only needed for optical disc playback)

Installation
------------

- extract the plugin archive and change to the folder
- using "make install" the plugin will be compiled and installed on your system
- adjust the command line arguments to fit your needs

Command line arguments
----------------------

-a audio
  mpv -audio-device (Default: alsa:device=default)
  The audio out device which is used by mpv, this is directly passed as ao to mpv.

-v video
  mpv --vo (Default: vdpau)
  The video out device which is used by mpv, this is directly passed as vo to mpv.

-h hwdec
  mpv -hwdec (Default: vdpau)

  to mpv. For latest mpv use -h gpu (also see -g parameter)

-c gpuctx
  mpv --gpu-context (Default: auto)
  The GPU context (auto, x11, drm, x11egl).

  It is best to set "-v gpu -h auto".
  Set "-v gpu -h cuda -c x11" for use cuda with X11 and GLX. Latest mpv set X11 GLX deprecated, you need configure mpv with --enable-gl-x11.
  Set "-v gpu -h auto -c drm" for use drm output and hardware decoder without X11.
  Set "-v vdpau -h vdpau -c x11" for use vpdau with X11 and GLX.
  Set "-v vaapi -h vaapi -c x11" for use vaapi with X11 and GLX, GLX is slower in Intel than EGL.
  Set "-v gpu -h vaapi-copy" for use vaapi with X11 and EGL.

-d device
  optical disc device (Default: /dev/dvd)
  The device which is used for playback of optical media

-l languages
  languages for audio and subtitles (Default: deu,de,ger,eng,en)"
  The default languages choosen for audio and subtitles. Please note since different
  container formats are using different standards you should pass this at least in
  ISO-639-1 (two letters) and 639-2 (three letters). The list is seperated by comma.
  This will is passed as alang and slang to mpv.

-b /dir
  file browser root directory

-x extensions for playlists
  files with this extensions are handled as playlists (Default: m3u,ini,pls,txt,playlist)

-r
  switch modeline to refresh rate of played file
  xrandr is needed for this to work. If no xrandr is detected during compile time
  this feature will be deactivated.

-m text
  the text displayed in VDR main menu (Default: MPV)

-s
  normally mpv tries to autoload LUA scripts, if this parameter is set no scripts are loaded
  The mpv config directory is a "RESDIR/plugins/mpv/", so scripts directory is a "RESDIR/plugins/mpv/scripts"
  Look in vdr/Makefile and vdr/Make.config for which RESDIR location

-w
   windowed mode, not fullscreen

-g geometry
  You can set X11 geometry with this parameter [W[xH]][+-x+-y][/WS] or x:y.
  Resolution of OSD get from settings of output plugin (softhd*). OSD is scaled to video size.
